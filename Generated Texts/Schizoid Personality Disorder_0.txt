They may have an extreme need for independence and also have difficulty showing any emotion or feelings at all. People with this disorder often prefer to be alone and may avoid even close relationships with family and friends. They usually display an obsessive interest in a particular activity alone, such as reading or writing. Other behavior may include avoidance of eye contact, difficulty understanding abstract conversations, non-engagement in conversations, and self-isolation. They may also have a fear or distrust of others. Treatment may include medication, therapy, and social skills training.
