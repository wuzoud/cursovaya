Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may appear withdrawn, distant, and uninterested in social activities. They typically have few interpersonal relationships, usually only a close family member. They may appear to be socially awkward or shy and lack emotional range. They generally prefer to be alone and do not find pleasure in activities that involve interactions with others. They may have difficulty expressing emotions appropriately and may be seen as cold or aloof.
