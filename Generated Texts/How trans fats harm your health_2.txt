Trans fats are commonly used in processed foods because they increase shelf life and are inexpensive to produce. The problem is, these fats can have a detrimental effect on your health.

Trans fats raise your bad cholesterol (LDL) and lower your good cholesterol (HDL). This increases your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Trans fats also increase inflammation in your body, which can lead to a variety of chronic health problems. Studies have also linked trans fats to an increased risk of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

The best way to reduce your risk of health problems related to trans fats is to avoid processed and fast foods, as these usually contain high amounts of trans fats. Choosing fresh, whole foods can help you reduce your trans fat intake and protect your health.
