They raise levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) and lower levels of good cholesterol (HDL) in the blood, leading to plaque build-up inside arteries. This can cause a heart attack or stroke. Trans fats can also reduce the effectiveness of insulin, leading to greater risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, consuming trans fats has been linked to higher levels of inflammation, which can increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer. Finally, trans fats have also been linked to increased levels of abdominal fat, which can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and other obesity-related conditions.
