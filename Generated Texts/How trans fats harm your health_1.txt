This process creates a solidified oil which is found in many processed foods such as crackers, french fries, doughnuts, and cookies. Trans fats can also be found in some margarines, vegetable shortenings, and certain types of cooking oils.

Trans fats increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. They raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. This can lead to a buildup of cholesterol and fat in your arteries, causing them to narrow and increase your risk for heart attack and stroke. Trans fats can also increase the production of inflammatory chemicals in your body, which are linked to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. In addition, trans fats have been linked to an increased risk for several other chronic conditions including obesity, depression, and certain cancers.
