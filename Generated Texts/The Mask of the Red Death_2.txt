 Comes Alive

It was a night of terror and dread, as all across the land the rumble of thunder joined the howling of the wind. The sky was a bleak red, and an unearthly glow from the heavens illuminated the night with an eerie light. The air was thick with fear and anticipation as a most sinister figure descended from the sky - the Mask of the Red Death.

The figure balanced menacingly upon a stretcher of ivory and obsidian. Its face was a deathly pallor, its eyes were madness, and its lips were a cruel, crimson grin. Hooded in a velvet gown of black, a skeletal hand gripped a staff, and a skeletal foot perched atop a plinth of iron.

Slowly its movement began and its eyes connected with every living creature they met. Every movement sent a chill down the spines of those who endured its gaze, for they knew that this could only mean one thing - death. As the figure stalked closer, it began to speak in a deep, hollow voice - a voice that filled one with an overwhelming sense of dread.

“I am the Mask of the Red Death and I have come to take the lives of the living,” it bellowed. “I have come to end your lives, and no one can escape my grasp.”

The figure descended quickly, and many of those who were unfortunate enough to still remain standing were quickly consumed by the redness of death. The world was left in darkness and despair, as the terrifying sight of the Mask of the Red Death vanished into the night.
