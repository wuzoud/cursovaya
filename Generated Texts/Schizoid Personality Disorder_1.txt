These symptoms often lead to loneliness and difficulty in forming meaningful, long-term relationships. Common signs of Schizoid Personality Disorder include avoiding social activities, an unwillingness to share personal information, difficulty expressing emotions, a lack of empathy, and little interest in romantic relationships. Other symptoms may include a preference for solitary activities, difficulty sustaining relationships, and a lack of pleasure in life. Diagnosis of this disorder requires an in-depth assessment of a person's behavioral patterns and history. Treatment generally involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications such as antidepressants.
