The universal symbol of mortality and impending doom, the mask is a sinister, red-eyed, pallid face, ensconced in a black robe and hood with seven pointed darts of blood. It is said to represent the terror of death and the inevitability of its approach. The mask is known to appear in various forms, often appearing as a skeletal face or a gaunt figure with a dark, glowing presence. The mask is often used as a symbol in literature, art, and film, as it represents the looming presence of death, which can touch anyone, regardless of time or place.
